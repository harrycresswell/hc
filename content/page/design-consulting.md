If you have a project which you think I might be a good fit for or just want to start a conversation about absolutely anything, then feel free to give me a shout. For me it's all about exciting new experiences, meeting interesting people and working on great products. Even if you're in the arctic with zero budget get in touch. We might still be able to work something out.

## How we can work together

#### Design Strategy

We'll discuss your business objectives in depth, then I'll pick apart your design and content (up to three key pages from your site), and write a detailed 1,000+ word report on how to make things better.

#### Design/Single

A redesign of a single page on your website, or the creation of a new one. After a brainstorming session, I'll create a design for you (delivered as a Photoshop file) and write a single-page report on extracting maximum juice from your new baby. If you don't have a web developer to build my design, I can advise on that too.

#### Design/Build

I'll design and build a beautifully simple website which is easy for you to update, and delivers maximum impact for your business.
