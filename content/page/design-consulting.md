If you're trying to build a business online but don't know where to start I can help you:

- Build a website for your business *(which you can manage!)*.
- Create a strategy to find more clients and increase your revenue.
- Optimise your current website to increase customer conversions and sell more products.


## Why I do this

For me it's all about exciting new experiences. I love helping inspiring people bring their ideas to life by building great sustainable businesses. If that's not a good enough reason; I wrote a whole article on [why i'm in business](start with why).


## How we can work together

#### Design Strategy

We'll discuss your business objectives in depth, then I'll pick apart your design and content (up to three key pages from your site), and write a detailed 1,000+ word report on how to make things better.

#### Design/Single

A redesign of a single page on your website, or the creation of a new one. After a brainstorming session, I'll create a design for you (delivered as a Photoshop file) and write a single-page report on extracting maximum juice from your new baby. If you don't have a web developer to build my design, I can advise on that too.

#### Design/Build

I'll design and build a beautifully simple website which is easy for you to update, and delivers maximum impact for your business.

## It's not just about the money

Even if you're in the arctic with zero budget we should have a chat. If we're on the same page then we still might be able to work something out. Whatever the case, I sure i'll have some friendly advise. I'm always happy to help point you in the right direction.
