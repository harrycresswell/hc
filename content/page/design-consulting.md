 I'm here to help you bring your project to life. If you're aiming to grow your business online I can help you:

- **Evaluate your business goals** and make a solid plan of action.
- **Build a website** *(which you can manage)*.
- Create a strategy to **find more clients and increase your revenue**.
- Optimise your current website to **increase customer conversions**.
- **Build and market your product** to the right audience.


## How we can work together

It can be a big decision choosing who you work with to build your business.

In all honesty, there are many ways you can grow your business yourself — you don't always need to spend a ton of money on fancy design consultancy.

That being said, going it alone isn't necessarily for everyone, in which case you might want to work with someone like me.

Below I have outline a few ways I have successfully worked with previous clients — to build their vision and produce results.

### Design strategy: Report

We'll discuss* your business objectives in depth, analysing your goals and identify both your strengths and weaknesses. Together we will formulate a plan of action for your online presence.

I will then write a detailed 1,000+ word report on how  best to grow your business online.

_*This can take place via Skype or in person_.

### Marketing: Landing page and mailing list

If you have a product or even just an idea for one, then it's time to get it out in the real world and collect some data. This is the a great, low risk way of finding out if your product has potential.

I'll design and build **a simple one page landing page** and set you up with **a mailing list**, so you can collect emails and start building your client leads.  

Remember those old *'coming soon'* pages, sort of like that but super charged with function and filled with purpose.

### Bespoke: Design & code

Do you need **a bespoke Wordpress site** (that's your very own unique theme built from scratch) or perhaps **a way to sell your products online** (using Shopify)? Maybe you just need something simple like **a static site**.

Whatever it may be, if you want full control of your website and it's user experience, then I can design and build a full website experience for you and your audience.
