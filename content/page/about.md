## Harry who?

I’m Harry Cresswell, a digital product designer from London. I help young companies get the results they want. Over the years I’ve had a lot of experience building brands, websites and digital products from the ground up.

### Colophon

This site was built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), an open source static site generator. It's hosted for free using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The CSS is written in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), and built on top of Harry Robert's [inuitcss](https://github.com/inuitcss), a sass based OOCSS framework. It also follows Harry's [ITCSS](http://itcss.io/) and [BEM](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/) methodologies for writing scaleable CSS architecture. I use [GulpJS](http://gulpjs.com/) for the build system.

All the code can be found on [github](https://github.com/harrycresswell). Use it for your own learning and development but please don't just rip off the code.

If you want to know more i've written about it in depth in this [article](https://github.com/harrycresswell).

Support the creative commons licence and the open source way of thinking :).
