If you are here for the first time, I made this site as a place to share my experience of **designing and coding websites**.

You will also find me writing about **building a successful solo business around your lifestyle**. That means a business of one, where you are in charge. I figured I probably have a few tips seeing as I've done it myself.

I'm also using it as a place to store my notes on **everything I'm learning from books, articles and various other material**. Hopefully you might pick up some useful lessons whilst you're here.

## A little more about me

I started teaching myself design and code in 2006 whilst I was studying art.

I tried a *"real job"* in Insurance after graduating, but in 2010 I quit to focus on **making websites for a living**. I quickly realised my time was better spent doing something I enjoyed — helping people solve problems with design.

My **mission for 2017** is to utilise my **background in art** (which I often neglect) combined with my skills as a developer to help others achieve their goals.

Right now i'm living between London and Hamburg where **I work remotely** with a handful of clients. When i'm not at my desk I enjoy **screen printing, painting, yoga, climbing and hiking**.

## Where to go next

There are a few places to go from here. You can [read some of my articles](http://localhost:1313/articles/) or [check out my reading list](http://localhost:1313/reading/) where I keep notes on the things I'm learning.

You can also follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/harrycresswell) or see my full resume on [LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/harrycresswell

If you’re interested in [working with me](http://localhost:1313/design-consulting/), you might be interested in a few recent projects i've worked on:

### Recent projects

- [On Display – International fashion week reportage](http://ondsply.co/).
_This was a project I pursued from 2013 - 2016. It took me from New York, to London, then onto Milan and finally Paris for 2 months of the year._


## How I made this site

For those who are interested in how I built this site, here's a quick overview:

I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a lightening fast static site engine. It's hosted for free on [Github](https://github.com/harrycresswell/hc).

The CSS is written in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), and follows the [BEM](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/) methodology for writing scaleable CSS architecture. I use [GulpJS](http://gulpjs.com/) to run development tasks and build a site ready for production.

I'm using the CDN [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for continuous deployment, so when I push changes to Github it automatically deploys the live site.

All the code can be found on my [github](https://github.com/harrycresswell/hc) page. Use it for your own learning and development but please don't just rip it off. If you have any questions [drop me an email](mailto:studio@harrycresswell.com) or a [tweet](https://twitter.com/harrycresswell). I'd be more than happy to help.

## Thanks

If you made it this far, then thanks a lot. I appreciate you taking the time to look at my website. I hope you enjoyed what you've been reading.

If you wish to read more, <a href ="http://localhost:1313/#newsletter">i'd like your email address</a> so I can send you **articles that’ll help to improve your solo business**.

I only send one email a week, on a Sunday evening. So it will be ready, waiting for you to read when you hit the grind on a Monday morning.
