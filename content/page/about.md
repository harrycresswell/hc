If you are here for the first time, I made this site as a place to share my experience of **designing and coding websites**.

You might also find me nattering about content strategy, learning how to write and **building a business around your lifestyle**.

You'll also find notes on **everything I'm learning from books, articles and various other material**. Hopefully you might pick up some useful lessons whilst you're here.

## A little more about me

I started teaching myself design and code in 2006 whilst I was studying art.

I tried a *"real job"* in Insurance after graduating, but quit in 2010 to focus on **making websites for a living**. I quickly realised my time was better spent doing something I enjoyed — helping people solve problems with design.

I now spend my time between London and Hamburg, where **I work remotely** for a handful of clients.

## How I made this site

For those who are interested in how I built this site, here's a quick overview:

I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a lightening fast static site engine. It's hosted for free on [Github](https://github.com/harrycresswell/hc).

The CSS is written in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), and follows the [BEM](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/) methodology for writing scaleable CSS architecture. I use [GulpJS](http://gulpjs.com/) to run development tasks and build a site ready for production.

I'm using the CDN [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for continuous deployment, so when I push changes to Github it automatically deploys the live site.

All the code can be found on my [github](https://github.com/harrycresswell/hc) page. Use it for your own learning and development but please don't just rip it off. If you have any questions [drop me an email](mailto:studio@harrycresswell.com) or a [tweet](https://twitter.com/harrycresswell). I'd be more than happy to help.

## Thanks

If you wish to read more, <a href ="http://localhost:1313/#newsletter">i'd like your email address</a> so I can send you **articles that’ll help to improve your business**.

I only send one email a week, on a Sunday evening. So it will be ready, waiting for you to read when you hit the grind on a Monday morning.
