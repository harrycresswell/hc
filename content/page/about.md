+++

If you are here for the first time, I made this site as a place to share my experience of **designing and coding websites**.

You will find me writing about useful topics such as **design, development and marketing**. A few of the essential skills it takes to **build a successful solo business**.

I'm also using it as a place to document my design process, build useful tools, and record **everything I'm learning from books, articles and various other material**. Hopefully you might pick up some useful lessons whilst you're here.

## A little more about me

I started teaching myself design and code in 2006 whilst I was studying art.

I tried a *"real job"* in Insurance after graduating, but in 2010 I quit to focus on **making websites for a living**. I quickly realised my time was better spent doing something I enjoyed — helping people solve problems with design.

My **mission for 2017** is to utilise my **background in art and printmaking** (which I often neglect) — combined with my skills as a developer — to help others achieve their goals.

Right now i'm living between London and Hamburg where **I work remotely** with a handful of clients.

If I'm not at my desk i'm probably out hiking, climbing or taking pictures.

## How I made this site

For the geeks out there, here's a quick overview of how I built this site:

I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a lightening fast static site engine. It's hosted for free on [Github](https://github.com/harrycresswell/hc).

The CSS is written in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), and follows the [BEM](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/) methodology for writing scaleable CSS architecture. I use [GulpJS](http://gulpjs.com/) to run development tasks and build a site ready for production.

I'm using the CDN [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for continuous deployment, so when I push changes to Github it automatically deploys the live site.

All the code can be found on my [github](https://github.com/harrycresswell/hc) page. Use it for your own learning and development but please don't just rip it off. If you have any questions [drop me an email](mailto:studio@harrycresswell.com) or a [tweet](https://twitter.com/harrycresswell). I'd be more than happy to help.
