I’m Harry Cresswell, a digital product designer from London. **I help young companies get the results they want.** Over the years I’ve had a lot of experience building brands, websites and digital products from the ground up.

### Colophon

This site was built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a super fast static site engine. It's hosted for free using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The CSS is written in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), follows the [BEM](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/) methodology for writing scaleable CSS architecture. I use [GulpJS](http://gulpjs.com/) for the build system.

All the code can be found on [github](https://github.com/hugo-hc). Use it for your own learning and development but please don't just rip off the code.
