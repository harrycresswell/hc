description: "About this website"

I created this website **to share the things I've learnt about design and marketing**, so you can skip to what works and avoid what doesn't.

You'll mostly find **advice on how to building small sustainable businesses**. There might also be the odd tutorial here and there, and a few life thoughts i've picked up along the way.

My aim is to **help independent creatives trying to grow their business**. However it might also benefit other designers, hackers and side project geeks like myself.


### A little more about me

I’m Harry Cresswell. My journey hasn't been the most conventional. 6 years ago I quit my job in Insurance and went freelance right away. Not something i'd ordinarily advise, but in my case it work out just fine.

I've been designing and coding **websites for small business owners**, both as a freelance and a contractor ever since. More recently i've been helping clients understand the nuts and bolts of business, in order to help them grow and reach their goals.

### Why I created this site

Clients often say they need a website or a logo because that's what they *think* they should be asking for.

There are plenty of "web and brand designers"  who will help you build a website or design a logo at the flip of a hat.

Often this isn't the best solution.

I want to help clients understand their business goals and think about the questions they want to ask before they ask them.

Understanding your lead to a better website for both you and the people you want to use it.

Often there is a whole lot more to it.

9 times out of 10 they are struggling with business fundamentals.

My aim is to help clients

A website is useless unless you know what to do with it.


There are common "We need a logo" and "can you build me a website".

 Thinking a website will fix business problems isn't always right.



I want to help guide clients in setting up their business [the right way](In an ethical and responsible way), from the start. That might involve a website but it's not the


Below are the places I noticed most people getting stuck on:

- Why isn't my a new website increasing traffic and sales?
- Most of us are still struggling to get the business fundamentals right.
- Most of us don't understand online growth strategies.
- Most of us need help making their website profitable.

I now work mostly on early stage projects. I'm on a mission



Currently I work partly as a UX/UI Design contractor at `@angel__network`

### How I made this site

For those who are interested in how I built this site, here's a quick overview:

I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a lightening fast static site engine. It's hosted for free using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The CSS is written in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), and follows the [BEM](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/) methodology for writing scaleable CSS architecture. I use [GulpJS](http://gulpjs.com/) for the build system.

All the code can be found on my [github](https://github.com/harrycresswell/hc). Use it for your own learning and development but please don't just rip off the code. If you have any questions [drop me an email](mailto:studio@harrycresswell.com) or a [tweet](https://twitter.com/harrycresswell).
