If you are here for the first time, I made this site as a place to share my experience of **designing and coding websites**.

You'll also find notes on **everything I'm learning from books, articles and various other material**. Hopefully you might pick up some useful lessons whilst you're here.

## A little more about me

I started teaching myself design and code in 2006 whilst I was studying art.

I tried a *"real job"* in Insurance after graduating, but quit in 2010 to focus on **making websites for a living**. I realised my time was probably better spent doing something I really enjoyed — designing and building products.

I now live between London and Hamburg, where **I work remotely** for a handful of clients.

## Where to go next

There are a few places to go from here. You can [read some of my articles](http://localhost:1313/articles/) or [see my bookshelf](http://localhost:1313/reading/) for some great books on starting a successful business.

You can also follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/harrycresswell) or see my full resume on [LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/harrycresswell
).

## How I made this site

For those who are interested in how I built this site, here's a quick overview:

I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a lightening fast static site engine. It's hosted for free using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The CSS is written in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), and follows the [BEM](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/) methodology for writing scaleable CSS architecture. I use [GulpJS](http://gulpjs.com/) for the build system.

All the code can be found on my [github](https://github.com/harrycresswell/hc). Use it for your own learning and development but please don't just rip off the code. If you have any questions [drop me an email](mailto:studio@harrycresswell.com) or a [tweet](https://twitter.com/harrycresswell). I'd be more than happy to help.

## Thanks

If you made it this far, then thanks, I appreciate you taking the time to look at my website and I hope you enjoyed what you've been reading.

If you wish to read more, i'd like your email address so I can send you **well thought-out articles that’ll help to improve your business skills**.

I only send one a week, on a Sunday.

This is where I focus most my time and effort – providing useful actionable advice for my subscribers.
