### Colophon

For those who are interested in how I built this site, here's a quick overview. I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a lightening fast static site engine. It's hosted for free using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The CSS is written in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), and follows the [BEM](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/) methodology for writing scaleable CSS architecture. I use [GulpJS](http://gulpjs.com/) for the build system.

All the code can be found on my [github](https://github.com/harrycresswell/hc). Use it for your own learning and development but please don't just rip off the code. If you have any questions [drop me an email](mailto:studio@harrycresswell.com) or [tweet](https://twitter.com/harrycresswell).
