description: "About this website"
---

I created this website **to share the things I've learnt about design and marketing**, so (hopefully) you can skip to what works and avoid what doesn't.

You'll mostly find **ideas on how to build a sustainable business you're proud of**. There might also be the odd tutorial here and there, and a few thoughts on life i've picked up along the way.

My main aim is to **help independent creatives trying to grow their business**. If that's you, then you're in the right place. If you're a designer, hacker or a side project geek – like myself, you might also find some of what I write useful.


### A little more about me

I’m Harry Cresswell. My journey hasn't been the most conventional. 6 years ago I quit my job in Insurance and went freelance right away. Not something that tends to be advised, but in my case it work out fine.
I've been **designing and coding websites**, both as a freelance and a contractor ever since.

More recently i've been helping clients **understand the nuts and bolts of bootstrapping a business**. For a lot of creatives, business isn't all that interesting, but having a solid understanding of the basics is essential. If you want to grow and reach your goals, business strategy is something you need to understand – it will help you build a better business.

### How I made this site

For those who are interested in how I built this site, here's a quick overview:

I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a lightening fast static site engine. It's hosted for free using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The CSS is written in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), and follows the [BEM](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/) methodology for writing scaleable CSS architecture. I use [GulpJS](http://gulpjs.com/) for the build system.

All the code can be found on my [github](https://github.com/harrycresswell/hc). Use it for your own learning and development but please don't just rip off the code. If you have any questions [drop me an email](mailto:studio@harrycresswell.com) or a [tweet](https://twitter.com/harrycresswell). I'd be more than happy to help.
