If you are here for the first time, I made this site as a place to share my experience of **working as a designer** and **running a solo business**.

I'm also using it as a place to document my design process and record [everything I'm learning](https://www.harrycresswell.com/reading/) from books, articles and various other material.

Hopefully you might pick up some useful lessons whilst you're here.

## A little more about me

I started teaching myself design and code in 2006 whilst I was studying art.

I tried a *"real job"* in Insurance after graduating university, but quit in 2010 to focus on **making websites for a living** and other creative pursuits.

Right now I'm living between London and Hamburg where **I work remotely** with a handful of clients. When I'm not at my desk I enjoy hiking, climbing and taking pictures.
