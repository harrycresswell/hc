I'm in London where I’m focusing on the following things:

- Re-designing [In Detail](https://indtl.com/)
- Working on my 4th Typeface — TS Sans.
- Writing more and documenting my design processes

Right now these are my priorities, I'm saying no to most other stuff...saying that, I'm still [open to opportunities](https://www.harrycresswell.com/contact/).

PS – I just published an article on [Medium](https://medium.com/@harrycresswell/) about how I'm [using Sketch Libraries to build a better design system](https://medium.com/@harrycresswell/using-sketch-libraries-to-build-a-better-ui-design-system-part-1-26f5660f3c98).
