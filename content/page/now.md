I'm currently in London, where I'm focusing on the following things:

- Improving my skills as a type designer.
- Re-designing parts of [In Detail](https://indtl.com/)
- Working on a front-end prototype for [a new messaging system](http://harrycresswell.co.uk/client/ain/ain-messenger/).
- Pushing myself to write more.

Right now these are my priorities so I'm saying no to most other stuff...[but not all](https://www.harrycresswell.com/contact/).

P.S. - I released another [free hand painted font](https://gum.co/risque), as part of my [Type Services](https://typeservices.co/) side project. Go check it out if you haven't already.
