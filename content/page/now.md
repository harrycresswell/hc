I'm in Hamburg for the next 3 weeks where I’m focusing on the following things:

- Learning German at [DeutschAkademie](https://www.deutschakademie.de/hamburg/)
- Re-designing [In Detail](https://indtl.com/)
- Working on my 4th Typeface — TS Sans.

Right now these are my priorities, I'm saying no to most other stuff...saying that, I'm still [open to opportunities](https://www.harrycresswell.com/contact/).
