I'm back in London after two weeks off in Tuscany, Italy. I'm now focusing on the following things:

- Editing pictures.
- On-going [projects with AIN](https://www.angelinvestmentnetwork.co.uk/office-space).
- [Writing articles](https://www.harrycresswell.com/articles/) for my website and [weekly mailout](https://www.harrycresswell.com/newsletter/).

Right now these are my priorities so I'm saying no to most other stuff...[but not all](https://www.harrycresswell.com/contact/).

P.S. -  I just released [a free brush script](https://gum.co/europa). Check it out if you haven't already
