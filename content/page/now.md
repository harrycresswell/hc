I'm back in Hamburg for the week, where I'm focusing on the following things:

- Getting back into illustration.
- Re-designing parts of [In Detail](https://indtl.com/)
- Various [projects with AIN](https://www.angelinvestmentnetwork.co.uk/office-space).
- Writing [my weekly mailout](https://www.harrycresswell.com/newsletter/).

Right now these are my priorities so I'm saying no to most other stuff...[but not all](https://www.harrycresswell.com/contact/).

P.S. - I released another [free hand painted font](https://gum.co/risque), as part of my [Type Services](https://typeservices.co/) side project. Go check it out if you haven't already.
