I'm back in Hamburg for the next couple of weeks, where i'm focusing on the following things:

- On-going [projects with AIN](https://www.angelinvestmentnetwork.co.uk/office-space).
- Working on [my lettering side project](https://www.instagram.com/typeservices/). I just released a free brush script.
- [Writing articles](https://www.harrycresswell.com/articles/) for my website and weekly mail out.
- Teaching myself how to shoot food.

Right now these are my priorities so I'm saying no to most other stuff...[but not all](https://www.harrycresswell.com/contact/).
