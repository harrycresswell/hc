I'm back in Hamburg for the next couple of weeks, where i'm focusing on the following things:

- On-going [projects with AIN](https://www.angelinvestmentnetwork.co.uk/office-space).
- Working on a new website for [my lettering side project](https://www.instagram.com/typeservices/).
-  I just released [a free brush script](https://gum.co/europa).
- [Writing articles](https://www.harrycresswell.com/articles/) for my website and [weekly mailout](https://www.harrycresswell.com/newsletter/).

Right now these are my priorities so I'm saying no to most other stuff...[but not all](https://www.harrycresswell.com/contact/).
