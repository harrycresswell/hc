I'm in California for two weeks where I'm focusing on these things:

- Taking pictures.
- Camping in Joshua Tree.
- Hiking in Yosemite.
- Not looking at a computer screen.

When i'm back I'll be picking up where I left off:

- Building a site [with Luke](https://lukeharvey.co.uk/) for the very talented Chloe Chalker.
- Working on [projects with AIN](https://www.angelinvestmentnetwork.co.uk/office-space).
- [Writing articles](https://www.harrycresswell.com/articles/) for my website and weekly mail out.
- Painting type for [a new project](](https://www.instagram.com/typeservices/)) i'm working on.
- Printing a new tee with [Dark Sky](https://soundcloud.com/dark-sky) for [Carhartt](https://www.carhartt-wip.com/en).
- Thinking about next steps with [We Art London](https://www.weartlondon.com/).

Right now these are my priorities so I'm saying no to most other stuff.
