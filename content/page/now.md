I'm back in Hamburg after two delightful weeks ignoring the internet, staying in motels and taking pictures of outdoor things in California.

I'm now focusing on:

- Edit pictures for my trip.
- Finishing Chloe Chalker's website [with Luke](https://lukeharvey.co.uk/)  .
- Working on [projects with AIN](https://www.angelinvestmentnetwork.co.uk/office-space).
- Making some improvements to [In Detail](https://intl.com/) with [Beanie](https://www.instagram.com/beaniemajor/).
- [Writing articles](https://www.harrycresswell.com/articles/) for my website and weekly mail out.
- Messing around with painted type for [a new project](https://www.instagram.com/typeservices/).
- Printing a tee with [Dark Sky](https://soundcloud.com/dark-sky) for [Carhartt](https://www.carhartt-wip.com/en).
- Thinking about next steps with [We Art London](https://www.weartlondon.com/).

Right now these are my priorities so I'm saying no to most other stuff...[but not all](https://www.harrycresswell.com/contact/).
