I'm in London right now, where i'm focusing on the following things:

- Building a Wordpress site for a new food related project.
- Making some improvements to [In Detail](https://intl.com/) with [Beanie](https://www.instagram.com/beaniemajor/).
- [Writing articles](https://www.harrycresswell.com/articles/) for my website and weekly mail out.
- On-going [projects with AIN](https://www.angelinvestmentnetwork.co.uk/office-space).
- Figuring out the direction of [my new project](https://www.instagram.com/typeservices/).

Right now these are my priorities so I'm saying no to most other stuff...[but not all](https://www.harrycresswell.com/contact/).
