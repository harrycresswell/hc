I'm back in Hamburg for the week, where I'm focusing on these things:

- Building a site [with Luke](https://lukeharvey.co.uk/) for the very talented Chloe Chalker.
- Working on [projects with AIN](https://www.angelinvestmentnetwork.co.uk/office-space).
- [Writing articles](https://www.harrycresswell.com/articles/) for my website and weekly mail out.
- Designing a new hand-painted typeface.
- Working with the [Dark Sky](https://soundcloud.com/dark-sky) boys to design a tee for [Carhartt](https://www.carhartt-wip.com/en).
- Thinking about next steps with [We Art London](https://www.weartlondon.com/).
- Preparing for a 2 week photography &amp; hiking trip to [California](https://goo.gl/bbaQGq).

Right now these are my priorities so I'm saying no to most other stuff.
