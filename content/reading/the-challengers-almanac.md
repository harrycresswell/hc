A curation of stories — experiences, failures, lessons learnt and ideas borrowed — from businesses and thinkers challenging the way business is done today.


## Notes

Challenger brands are businesses with purpose. Businesses who are  prepared to break the rules. Businesses that manage to blend having a positive impact on the world with being financially successful.

Often naivety leads companies to new and creative ways of working.

Most challenger companies begin life as side projects, created through passion.

They lack experience and a natural right to create. Saying They're not necessarily experts but why should that matter.

All successful people fail.

Transparent sense of purpose and a force of good challenging ethics and ideology.

Solving problems. Seeing something that needs to be done better.

**Proof of concept** — _"I started telling people my idea as if it already existed. I had customers. I had a business"_. Reminds me of <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/idea-to-paying-customers-in-7-weeks-how-we-did-it" target="_blank">Buffer's landing page POC</a>.

**Ask for help** — you can't do it alone. Passion and excitement is a great bargaining tool.

You need a purpose — that you love and others can believe in — and an idea to make something better.

**Procrastiwork** — work you do when you are putting off other work. _"The work you do when you're procrastinating is probably the work you should be doing for the rest of your life"_.

Let tiny victories pave your path. By doing so your path will present itself. Don't set overly ambitious goals.

Procrastiwork can help you maintain momentum with client work as you switch from project to project to keep excitement high.

Take time to understand what you love about the work your doing.

**The Holstee Mainifesto** – a company should be built around a lifestyle rather than the other way around.

Seeing business as a way to make an impact on the world and contribute to a cause you feel strongly about.

The only person you should listen to is the customer.

Ask for advise from other companies and people that inspire you. You'll be surprised at how much people are willing to share about what they have learnt and the mistakes they've made.

Figure out your message and put your energy into getting it across.

The most satisfying thing is knowing your business is a force of good and can make a difference to a cause you feel strongly about.

**Find a mentor** — someone who has been there before and can stear you in the right direction.

**On public speaking** — understand your audience so you can get an idea of what they want to know.


**10,000 hours** — in order to be an expert you have to spend 10,000 hours (approx. 10 years) practicing it. _From Malcom Gladwell: Outliers_.

Trust your own judgement. Have faith in your decisions. Take advise from people you respect an be prepared to act on it.

Behind most Challenger brands there is usually someone on a mission to solve a problem they have encountered in their lives.

Challengers change the way we think, act, feel, see and behave using design to express their vision.

It's not about building it fast, but building it right.

It's not the government who is going to solve our environmental issues, it's business.

_"Everytime I've done the right thing for the environment, i've mae a profit"_ — Yvon Chouinard.

"Business is the most powerful man-made force on the planet, so it is important for businesses to use that power to do the most good. It doesn't matter if a business is the biggest. It doesn't matter if it's the fastest growing. It matters if a business is the best in the world at being the best for the world."
