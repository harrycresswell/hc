## Why I do this

I've always loved building things. As a kid I always had a project on the go. I'd either be painting it or taking it apart. Fixing and rebuilding, changing bits as I went. Sometimes i'd get whatever it was working again. Other times pieces would lay abandoned. A heap of broken junk on the floor.

Looking back I guess I was interested in how stuff worked.

Since then I've got a lot better at building stuff that works. I started out building websites. That soon turned into helping others build websites. Eventually I was helping people build businesses – by far the biggest challenge, but easily the most rewarding.

Exciting new experiences make me tick. I love helping inspiring people bring their ideas to life. And I want to do as much good as possibly in the way I know how – by building great sustainable businesses.
