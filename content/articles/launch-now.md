<p class="intro">Launch your product before it's ready. Better still, when it's an idea in it's infancy. Your work will never be finished, so don't make the mistake of waiting until you perfect it before you release it.</p>

Always **prototype in public**. That means get a very basic version into the world as soon as you can. Don't try and make it perfect, it will inevitably change. Your product is a work in progress, so just make sure it articulates your idea, it's directed at your target audience, and you have a way to collect feedback, then get it out there.

**Don't be precious with your ideas**, someone's already had them. So forget the NDA's. Unless you work for the military or you're building a top secret product for the government, you're wasting your time.

**Share your ideas** with as many people as you can. This is the low risk way to prove your concept and validate your idea. It's the easiest way to test the water and see if people like what you're building. The worst thing you can do is waste your time and energy on something know one wants.

So **gather feedback, user test, collect data, listen**. Use this research to improve your product. You can always iterate. If you do this you will find yourself creating the product that people want. No second guessing or building products based on assumption.

So always **back up any assumptions you might have with real data** before you build your product. We live in a data driven world, so start collecting it. [Send out a questionnaire](https://www.typeform.com/) or build [a clever product landing page](https://www.harrycresswell.com/design-consulting/). Sometimes simple is best.

As long as you get the worst, most unpolished version of your product out there first, you will set yourself up for the best chance of success.

In any case, you can always make it better later.


_Note: I've been meaning to write this for a while, after reading a post by Joel Gascoigne from Buffer (link below) many years ago. I'm trying to apply this same mentality to my writing. Get it out there. Improve it later._
