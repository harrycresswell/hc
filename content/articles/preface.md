I’m pretending to write a book here. The old way. Pen paper ink typewriter. Take your pick. I spend far to much time staring at a screen, my eyes hurt and it shows. Visualisation might be the only fix.<!--more-->

Ok, Vamonos. On with the show.

So every good book begins with a preface right? and seeing as now i’m this wannabe hot shot writer guy I figured I’d kick things off in typical paperback fashion.. yep you guest it.. with a preface.

To my knowledge, [the Preface](http://www.com) is all about outlining the subject matter of the book you’re about to read . So that seems like a fairly good place to start.


## What i’ll be writing about and who for

Originally I thought i might writing technical articles for fellow computer nerds. I could be the next [Chris Coyier](http://www.com) and start [a great podcast for css folk](http://www.com). I mean I still might write the odd one or two but i figured there was a lot of that stuff already out there.

I decided instead to put some of my classic client advise into practice. I thought long and hard about my [positioning](http://www.com) and my [USP](http://www.com). I thought about my experience and expertise, and how that might make me different from others.

(Read my articles on positioning and USP to get some tips)

### What I finally realised

Hitting 30 has been a big one. I started freaking out about the amount of value i was creating and if I was really a good person. Was I helping others enough? (tell me all if you’re doing the same right now). But after so long sucking the internet dry of free resources (the modern way of learning a hell of a lot) and my entire 20s with a hangover, I guess it was time to ask the question.. what is my purpose?

**Fundamentally, i realised I enjoy helping people start ethical companies from scratch.**

I spend virtually all my working hours helping small companies and individuals bring their box fresh ideas to life. I realised all my freelance clients are exclusively start-ups and independent business owners. I’ve been the designer, the guy who knows about content marketing, or that guy who know about building websites (remember those free tutorials?).

For the last 2 years i’ve also been [working 3 days a week](http://www.com) as a UX consultant and UI designer at [a fundraising platform for start ups]. I’m starting to see the theme here.. and i must actually know a fair bit about this stuff.


### Next steps

Well it’s definitely about time I gave something back.. in fact, it’s been a long time coming.

And it seems like a fairly logical unselfish step to focus on my clients:

Creative individuals and independent business owners.

So in a nutshell ill be writing:

**honest actionable advice for creative individuals and independent business owners.**

My mission (which i’ve now accepted) is to help you set up your business online. And guide you as much as possible to [do it yourself](http://www.com).. because [you don’t have to pay big agency fees to big agency morons].

All thats in my head or that been lost throughout the years via conversation i will rediscover and catalogue here. For you.

After all, it’s what I’ve already been doing all this time.. I just forgot to write it down.
