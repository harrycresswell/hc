## The problem

Clients often say they need a website, because that's what they *think* they should be asking for.

>I need a logo and a website, can you help me!

It's something I hear all the time.

There are plenty of designer's who, at the flip of a hat, will gladly help you design a logo and a website. But often they're just happy to get the work. They're not really helping you understand your goals â€“ advising you on the best possible options you could take.

A better route to take is this:

**Try and understand *your* business goals first, then think about the questions you need to be asking, before you ask them**.

Ask yourself:

>Is this is the best course of action for my business?

*(It might well be in fact, but just make sure you've given it some thought first).*

### Understand your business goals first

A clear **understanding of your business goals** will lead to a better website, for both you and the people you want to use it.

After all,

 **a website isn't that useful if you know why you built it, or who you built it for in the first place**.

Be sure to think about what you're trying to achieve.

**I hope this website can help guide you** in making those decisions. If I can encourage you to think about what you want, for your business, then I have achieved my goals.

*(And that might involve a website but there's likely more to it than that.)*
