The first time I speak to potential clients, I always begin by asking a simple question. **Why are you in business?**
<!--more-->

It’s a great question. Most business owners either haven’t thought about it, or they’ve forgotten.

When you forget, you loose sight of why you started in the first place. For some it becomes just about the money. Then the product suffers and the brand weakens. For others, well in the end they just get sick of it altogether and end up moving on to something else.


## But why is it so important to ask ourselves why?

Knowing why will help you to find your purpose, your cause, your belief that inspires you to do what you do.

Finding your cause will help guide your business decisions and drive you to do great things. Your business roadmap will become clear as soon as you find your reason to get up in the morning, to go and do what you do. You will also find more customers. The right customers.  

Matt Lane, an entrepreneur behind [Beerbods](https://beerbods.co.uk/) writes in the excellent book [The Challenger’s Almanac](http://www.thechallengersalmanac.co.uk/):

>To start something worthwhile I believe you need two things. A purpose; something you love and that other people can believe in and an idea to make something better. You also need to keep having those ideas to stay ahead. If you get those things right people will want to help you, buy from you and spread the word.


## So how can you work out your why?


Think about this:



### If you already have a business

- What is it you do?
- Why did you set it up in the first place?
- What are you making better?
- How are you helping your customer?

Whatever it is you’re doing right now might well be what you believe in. If your business isn’t on the right track, then you might just need to re-evaluate your purpose.

The chances are your why is right in front of you. Staring you in the face. You just need to given it some thought. Maybe you just need to work on your alignment a bit.



### If you’re just starting out

- What do you love doing?
- Why do you want to set up a business?
- What things are you trying to improve?
- What problems are you trying to solve?
- Who would find it helpful?


The most important thing in this case is to identify what you enjoy doing most. Then try and find something in this area that you can make better.

If you’re not at either of these points, that's fine too.

So you can understand your true purpose, you first need to establish what it is you value.


## What is it you value?

Think about what it is you value in life. What makes you tick. What it is you believe in. Don’t rush it, take time to think about what you care about most.

Maybe you’re passion is cooking. Or yoga. Or building schools in Africa.

Something that always helps is to ask yourself the question: **What would I be doing right now for fun? (Watching TV doesn’t count!).**

Once you’ve worked out what you value in life, write it down. Research it. Discuss it. Then shout about it.

It’s the only way to find if there are others out there who believe in what you believe.

And so the next thing to establish is who you want to help.



## Who are the people you are trying to serve?

This is your audience of course.

Who are you prepared to inspire. Whether they are customers or clients you will need to serve someone in order to succeed.

Don’t make the mistake of thinking how can your customer can benefit your business. **First you need to think about how you can help them.** The money will follow.

Remember that emotion drives behaviour. Finding others who believe in your cause will help you to grow an audience of loyal believers. Those who are ready to follow you to the corners of the earth and back. **Not because of what you’re selling but because of why you’re doing it.**

>It’s those that start with why, that have the ability to inspire others around them, or find others that inspire them. Simon Sinek

A customers main interest is in themselves remember. Not you. They might just so happen to believe in what you believe.

People are far more likely to buy your product (in the end) if they believe in why you do what you do.

**So first you need to find the people who are willing to take your belief and make it their own.**

Simon Sinek puts it like this: [People don’t buy what you do, they buy why you do it.](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action)

*If the reason why you do what you do is only for money then you will never earn that much of it. You will most likely fail. The clock is ticking. You should make the change.*

The final thing to consider is how you want to help.

## How are you helping your customer?

Having said all this, it’s a long shot to expect people to buy your product just because they believe in a similar cause as you.

Theres something else we need to think about.

Once you find your audience, who believe in what you believe. You can't just shove a product in their face and expect them to buy.

**You need to work out what they need help with. And then help them.**

These are the people you are trying to serve remember. So serve them.

- What do your customers or clients need help with?
- What is it that people often ask you for help with?
- What is it that your clients come to you for advice on?


## Competition means choice.

Competition is not a bad thing. Far from it. Competition is a good thing, it forces us to go the extra mile to stand out from our competitors. Competition is what’s creating better companies. Companies who care.

The next generation of company has to better serve their customer, in order to be better than the last.

**To position yourself apart from your competition you will need follow suit. You will need to help people. It’s that simple.**

To go the extra mile you need to create value by giving, before you even try and ask for something in return. That will come later (in this case we're talking money for your product).

### People have more choice so expect more

People will always search for the company giving away the most value. The company most aligned with their own beliefs. The company who has helped them the most will end up getting their money.

This is the way buying decisions are made now. We are all sick of being sold things. You need to win your customers over with something more.

#### You might have heard these terms:

 - ’Customer lead’
- ’User first’

This rings true here.

To be a better company you have to pay attention to your customer. You have to put the user first. You have to care. You do this by helping them in the ways you can.

**So the question to ask is who am I prepared to serve? Who am I willing to help? Not how can I leverage them best for money.**

Think about what you would do if you didn’t need to work for a living. If instead you had to help someone.

Who would you help? You can focus on one person. It can actually help to be that specific. I use this technique a lot.

Knowing the answer to this is vital in understanding your business.

**Being honest and helpful breads loyalty. Be genuine and help others. You will create value, authority and a loyal customer base. It is the most effective way to grow your business. And you will be proud of what you achieve.**

*I plan to cover ways in which you can help your customers in a later article. One of the key areas we all need to understand more is inbound (content) marketing. And how that differs from Outbound marketing (paid advertising). But I will save that for another time.*


## To conclude

We should all remind ourselves from time - why we do what we do.

Understanding why will lead to better decision making. It help us focus on what we’re trying to achieve in business and in life.

Knowing why will also help you to understand what it is you value. And the reason you wanted to get out there and set up your business in the first place.

I hope this has helped you get a clearer understanding why it is you’re in business. If you still need help finding your feet, run through my ‘Start with why' primer over on typeform. Take your time to work through the questions and then hit ‘submit’ when you're done. I will get back to you with some feedback, and any advice I can give you to help you establish your why.

**Your values are your why**. Remember that if nothing else.
