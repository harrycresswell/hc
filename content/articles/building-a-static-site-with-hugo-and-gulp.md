## How I made this site

For the geeks out there, here's a quick overview of how I built this site:

I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a lightening fast static site engine. It's hosted for free on [Github](https://github.com/harrycresswell/hc).

The CSS is written in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), and follows the [BEM](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/) methodology for writing scaleable CSS architecture. I use [GulpJS](http://gulpjs.com/) to run development tasks and build a site ready for production.

I'm using the CDN [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for continuous deployment, so when I push changes to Github it automatically deploys the live site.

All the code can be found on my [github](https://github.com/harrycresswell/hc) page. Use it for your own learning and development but please don't just rip it off. If you have any questions [drop me an email](mailto:studio@harrycresswell.com) or a [tweet](https://twitter.com/harrycresswell/). I'd be more than happy to help.
