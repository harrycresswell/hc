By defining your values first you will be on a clear roadmap for your business.<!--more-->

## Value 1: I believe in total transparency

Ultimately my aim is always to be as open as possible with everyone no matter what it is i’m doing. I have nothing to hide, so nothing needs to be kept secret.


I’m equally transparent with my clients. From the outset of each project I will talk openly about timescales, budgets and my availability. If I have a holiday on the horizon I won’t just disappear.  

Throughout a project I document the process including any design decisions and progress we make. You will have access and be involved the whole way.


## Value 2: I believe in helping people build ethical products

I believe in working with people who genuinely care about what it is they are doing. If you are trying to improve this world (no matter how small your vision), in a way that you believe in, then I’m in.

Whilst I try and be as altruistic about what I do as possible, It really helps me sleep at night to know that the work I have helped to create has good intentions. I get a lot of satisfaction in knowing that the business goals can be a force of good and make a difference to a cause you feel strongly about.

With this in mind; if you’re setting up the new vaping company, I’m sorry but can’t help you.

Similarly, if you are looking to build the next app to get rich quick I’m out.

If you’re helping to solve the plastic problem in the oceans of this world then I want to hear from you! And yes.. someone is in fact working on this problem right now.


## Value 3: I believe we are all designers. The best way to create is together

We all have the ability to create great things. Whilst I might be the one people refer to as ‘the designer’, the designs I create are only as good as my understanding of your vision. In essence the better we can communicate, the better product we can create.

You will never have to listen to me fight my corner as to why something is right or wrong. I’m not one of those precious designer. Hell no! I don’t believe in arguments I believe in constructive conversation and collaboration. If something we design isn’t working then I haven’t clearly understood the problem we are trying to solve. We will go back and look at it again. Together.

The work we create is not my vanity project and shouldn’t be yours either. It’s a collaborative process we go through to arrive the solution which fundamentally solves a problem.
