Have you ever thought about what it is you value? Not just in business but in life. Whatever you value in life should be your shining light. Guiding your business. Every step of the way. <!--more-->

But your values aren't just there for you. They can also help to guide others, in their decision whether a company is one they wish to buy from, or work with in the future.

Here are my values:

## Value 1: I believe in total transparency

Ultimately my aim is always to be as open as possible with everyone, no matter what it is i’m doing. I have nothing to hide, so nothing needs to be kept secret.

I’m equally transparent with my clients. From the outset of each project I will talk openly about timescales, budgets and my availability. If I have a holiday on the horizon I won’t just disappear.  

Throughout a project I document the process, including any design decisions and progress we make. You will have access and be involved the whole way.

As you have probably guessed, I believe that writing is a fundamental part of effective design communication. You can expect well written, easy to digest documentation. In effect, I write like I talk.


## Value 2: I believe in good intentions

I believe in working with people who genuinely care about what it is they are doing. If you're trying to improve this world or help the people in it, in a way that you believe in, then I’m in. No matter how small or grand your vision.

I believe in helping people who are out to do good. And not just for their own personal gain. So if you’re helping to solve the plastic problem in the oceans of this world, and need help spreading the word, then I want to hear from you!
And yes.. someone is in fact working on [this problem](https://www.theoceancleanup.com/) right now.

Whilst I try and be as altruistic about what I do as possible, it helps me sleep at night to know that the work I have helped create is having a positive impact.

So if you’re setting up the new vaping company, and need help tricking google into ranking you higher, then I’m sorry but I can’t help you.

I get a lot of satisfaction in knowing that someones business goals can be a force of good. That they are making a difference to a cause they feel strongly about.

I believe we all have a responsibility to be ethical in what we do.

## Value 3: I believe in honesty

There are often times when a project isn't a good fit. It might be something I don't believe in or it's simply outside of my expertise. In which case, I will be totally honest if it's not something I can help with.

Likewise, if there is something you are not happy about, if you have concerns or if things aren't working out, let's discuss the problem. Honestly.

I have a specific focus on building content driven websites and marketing strategies. I mostly work independently, so tend to work with small teams and individuals. Essentially, I have to be honest with myself about the type of projects I can take on.

So if you're trying to build the next dating app or social network you're going to need a bigger team. It's probably not a job for me. Though I might be able to point you in the right direction.



## Value 4: I believe in collaboration

We all have the ability to create great things. Whilst I might be the one people refer to as ‘the designer’, the designs I create are only as good as my understanding of your vision. In essence the better we can communicate, the better product we can create.

You will never have to listen to me fight my corner as to why something is right or wrong. I’m not one of those precious designer. I don’t believe in arguments, I believe in constructive conversation and collaboration. If something we design isn’t working, then I haven’t clearly understood the problem we are trying to solve. We will go back and look at it again. Together as a team.

The work we create is not my vanity project and shouldn’t be yours either. Let's have some humility. It’s a collaborative process. We go through it to arrive the solution, which fundamentally solves a problem.

We are all designers. The best way to create brilliant products is to build cohesion and work together.

Hopefully this has helped you think about your own values.
